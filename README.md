All the challenges I have completed

Closest Value to Zero: https://github.com/SmithyACoding/Challenges/blob/b257761b8e0b1d17ed7567b42bf04bf75d352144/ClosestToZero.CS
The challenge of this was that some values were negative. However, this was easily solved using Math.Abs.

Merging strings alternatively: https://github.com/SmithyACoding/Challenges/blob/b257761b8e0b1d17ed7567b42bf04bf75d352144/AlternateMergeString.CS

The challenge of this was that one string could be longer than the other. In this case, you only want to keep concatenating values from the longer string.
